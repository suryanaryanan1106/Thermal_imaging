Disease prediction using thermal imaging is crucial because it can help in early detection of potential health issues by detecting changes in body temperature. 
This non-invasive method allows for quick screening of large populations and can be particularly useful in identifying infectious diseases such as fever-related illnesses. 
Additionally, thermal imaging technology provides a contactless and efficient way to monitor individuals in high-traffic areas like airports or hospitals. 
Thermal imaging identifies temperature changes in leaves caused by stress or disease. 
This enables early detection and intervention, preventing significant crop loss
